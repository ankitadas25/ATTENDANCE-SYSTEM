# ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM
This is a fast and secure Attendance marking system which involves facial recognition and detection technique. I have used python and worked on OpenCV and Face detection libraries.
It is incorporated with Firebase to connect it with a real time database which can store the data and retrieve it whenever needed.
This project aims to solve the issues related to attendance (like proxy) and also saves the time for both faculties and students.
